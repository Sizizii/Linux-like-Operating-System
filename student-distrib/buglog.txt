bug1: when try to enable the paging, the kernel will begin to reboot.
reason: when we set the value in the register ,we first set up cr0, then we set up cr4
solution: we should set up cr4 before setting up cr0

2022/3/20
bug2: when we use the assembly linkage, the program raise error that "no such instruction" for the assemble files
reason: when try to include the assemble files in the c files, the complier will not work
solution: make the assemble to be global and declare them in the .h file without including assemble files.

bug3: when I press the caps on the keyboard, the next letter i print out is not changed
reason: the caps_flag is still 0
solution: I change the judgement situation of caps_press

2022/3/19
bug4: the keyboard can only response to one key press, and after that it will stuck.
reason: no EOI is sent in some situation
solution: send EOI for every situation

--------------------checkpoint 2--------------------
2022/3/27
bug1: after press shift, the following output keys will continue being the shift type and never return normal type anymore
reason: never reach the judgement of shift release
solution: change the shift release to an outter loop.

2022/3/27
bug2: the second char that should be in the same line with the first line goes to the second line
reason: wrong judgement of screen coordinate
solution: set the last line x coordinate to 79, not 80

2022/3/27
bug3: when continue to press more than 128 times, the backspace is not working
reason: when judgement keybuffer is full is true, putc will not work
solution: when keybuffer is full, let putc work normally


2022/3/26
bug4: read_data will induce Page Fault
reason: I use memcpy to copy the whole block one by one. When it reaches the last block, I forget to consider the situation that the last block shouldn't be entirely copied to the buffer.
solution: set the copy nbytes for the last block correctly.

-------------------checkpoint 3----------------------
2022/4/8
bug1: using backspace will also delete the characters written by terminal
reason: terminal write simply write the character into the keyboard buffer, so backspace can access without noticing 
solution: set a global variable to indicate the terminal region and prevent access by user

2022/4/10
bug2: when call the execute, it cannot return to its parent when use exit()
reason: the system call handler doesn't set up properly and miss to save some registers
solution: set up the hardware context structure as mentioned

2022/4/10
bug3: Next time press l after ctrl+l is pressed , the whole screen is cleared, too
reason: ctrl_off not detected
solution: put judgement of crtl_off in the out loop

-------------------checkpoint 4----------------------
2022/4/16
bug1: page fault when testing cat 
reason: parsed arguments weren't stored into the new pcb structure
solution: initialize and store args into args_buf in execute

bug2: could not read arguments when testing getargs
reason: system call failed for getargs
solution: add the function into systemcall_table and change the checking conditions for system call number in handler_link.S

-------------------checkpoint 5----------------------
2022/4/29
bug1: cannot switch from one shell to the other shell in other terminal
reason: when initialize the shell, store the previous stack outside the function "process switch", so when we try to 
switch from one shell to the other, the stack is wrong
solution: store the stack of previous shell in the function "process switch" as other process

2022/4/30
bug2: when execute one program in terminal 0, the process in other terminals seems to get stuck from time to time
reason: we use the same rtc for three terminals, so the time will be confused since the terminal doesn't execute all the time when scheduling is working
solution: set up a rtc for each terminal, and update it when the terminal is currently executing.

2022/4/30
bug3: When switch between pingpong in different terminals, the image of some part of pingpong is not correct
reason: The calculation of video buffer is wrong
solution: modify functions and variables in terminal write to make buffer correct
